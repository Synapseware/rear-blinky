6.2mA, off
0.8mA when the MCU is disconnected (need sleep mode!)
190mA low
750mA high
80mA crazy blink
200mA on fade in/out
90mA on fade out
* 980mA on full-open from mosfet
* 1050mA on short circuit, 2000mAh 3.7v Lipo
	

* Watch for high-temperatures from the LED board!

All this will change when the regulator board is built, and sleep mode is available in the firmware for the MCU
